<h1>Basic knowledge</h1>
<p>In LoL, there are six primary roles that you can choose: Assassin, Fighter, Tank, Mage, Marksman, Support.</p>
<p>A basic game is a traditional 5v5 game. This means there are two teams; each team has five champions.</p>
<p>The 5v5 map has three lanes: top, mid, and bottom, and one additional "lane": jungle.</p>
<p>There are many tactics that can be adopted, but the dominated tactic is 1-1-1-2. It means one top laners, one jungler, one mid laner, and two bottom laners.</p>
<p>In normal games, blind pick is used. It means players from one team cannot see which champions are picked by the other team until both teams' champions are locked.</p>
<p>In ranked games, ban&pick is used. It means players from each team take turn to ban one champion and pick one champion per player. Each champion has his/her own strengths/weaknesses. Therefore, ban&pick allows players counter-pick the other team's champions.</p>
<p>In LoL, skills have two primary branches: skillshot and targeted skill. Skillshots are abilities that require player to aim in order to hit the target.
In contrast, targeted skills do not require aiming and can be used directly on champions.</p>
