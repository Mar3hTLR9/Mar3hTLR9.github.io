<h1>Retirement</h1>
<p>Every game has its end.</p>
<p>I have never thought that I would quit playing LoL one day. I have spent almost 7000 games on my main account during that six years.
The thing I love about LoL is that every single game is a challenge.
By playing new games, you meet new players, new tactics, and new ways to use a certain combo that you have never thought of before.
However, I can really feel my prime time on LoL had passed. My reaction time is significantly longer. I usually overcome this problem by logistic moves.
Logistic moves are moves that you minimize the chance that your champion will get hit from skillshots. This move is something that only experienced players can perform, but new players with low reaction time can overwhelm it easily.
I could not bare the fact that I was the reason causing the lost of the team, so I called it a game.
With that being said, I never really quit it. I still play it occationally, maybe one game a week, but only if my friends are playing.</p>
