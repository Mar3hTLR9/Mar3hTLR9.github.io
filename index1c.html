<h1>Thresh</h1>
<p>"The mind is a wondrous thing to tear apart." - Thresh</p>
<p>Thresh is a supporter in LoL. A supporter in LoL protects teamates and mainly controls vision on the map.
After watching a few matches of Madlife and Mata, I decided to play Thresh. Among four active abilities, Thresh has three skillshots.
It was a proof that I could handle a harder champion. Unlike other supporters, Thresh can be played both offense and defense.
His skillshots can open a combat or simply disengage enemies from killing teamates.</p>
