<h1>Ashe</h1>
<p>"One tribe, one people, one Freljord." - Ashe</p>
<p>If I remember it right, when you first begin playing LoL, they give you accesses to 8 basic champions. Ashe is one them.
Ashe is a marksman. I chose her as my starting champion because she is a ranged champion.
For a newbie, ranged champions allow you keep a distance from the enemies.
This distance gives you more time to react to enemies' skillshots. Skillshots are un-targeted skills, so they can be dodged. The longer the distance to the caster, the easier it is to dodge the ability.
Normally, marksmen are very weak if they lose that distance-advantage. Some abilities allow champions approach a target with ease. Therefore, marksman is usually used at bot lane, with the support of a supporter.
My friends who already had experiences in the game usually played supporter so that they could help me survive in the game.
Furthermore, Ashe has one extreme-long-ranged skillshot. It allowed me to play safely from a great distance.</p>
