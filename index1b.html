<h1>Fizz</h1>
<p>"You people can’t even breathe water. You’re boring." - Fizz</p>
<p>During my prime time, Fizz was a beast. Fizz himself is an assassin.
In LoL, an assassin is responsible for killing weak targets such as marksmen. The reason I chose Fizz because he has an untargetable skill.
Untargetabe skills in LoL are extremely rare. These skills allow a champion dodges all abilities if the timing is right.
Plus, Fizz can not only kill low-health targets, but also deal massive damage on high-resistant target. One of his skill is dealing damage based on maximum health.
These two abilities are very valueable if they are used at the right time. My win rate with Fizz was always more than 70%.</p>
